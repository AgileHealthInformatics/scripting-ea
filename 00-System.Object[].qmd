# Preface

Scripting in **Sparx Enterprise Architect (EA)** has always been both an art and a science.  
Most modellers discover the scripting window by accident, write a few lines of JScript or VBScript, and quickly realise that the possibilities extend far beyond simple automation.  
A well-structured script can transform EA from a drawing tool into a complete modelling environment—one that enforces standards, generates documentation, and maintains semantic consistency across large repositories.

This handbook was written for practitioners who have reached that moment of discovery and want to go further.  It assumes you already understand EA’s modelling concepts but want to learn how to harness its automation interface responsibly and effectively.  Each chapter builds practical skills through worked examples, annotated listings, and clear explanations of what is happening behind the scenes.

The code examples use a deliberately **verbose commenting style**. This reflects the author’s conviction that scripts in EA are not disposable experiments but integral parts of the architectural record. A script that can explain itself is a script that can be maintained, audited, and reused.

You will encounter snippets written in **JScript**, **VBScript**, and **Python**, each chosen for a particular purpose. JScript remains the most widely used within EA because of its direct integration and immediate execution. VBScript appears in legacy environments and in examples where readability or COM automation syntax is clearer. Python is included to illustrate how EA can be automated externally through its COM interface, opening the door to advanced analytics, testing, and integration pipelines.

Beyond code, this book emphasises **discipline**. Automation without discipline quickly becomes chaos. By treating scripts as first-class architectural artefacts—version-controlled, documented, and tested—you build confidence not only in your tools but in the models that depend on them.

The examples that follow have been developed and refined through real-world use across government, healthcare, and defence projects. They are designed to be copied, adapted, and improved. Each one begins with a clear purpose, a short description of assumptions, and a structured header that records when and why it was written.   Together they form a working library that you can evolve to suit your own organisation.

My hope is that this book helps you move from **drawing diagrams** to **engineering models**—from manipulating shapes on a screen to crafting automated reasoning tools that truly represent the systems you design. If it inspires you to share your own scripts, extend these techniques, or simply think differently about what EA can become, it will have achieved its purpose.
